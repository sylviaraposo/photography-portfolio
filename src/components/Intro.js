                    <h3>Hi!</h3>
                    <p>I'm a family photographer named <strong>Sylvia</strong> located in <strong>Clarington</strong>. I have a passion for the outdoors, animals, and capturing special moments between loved ones.</p>

                    <p>I am currently offering Summer Minis around <strong>Clarington and Durham Region</strong> for $100/30minutes of shooting and 15-20 edited images for you and up to 3 of your loved ones. I have a list of desirable locations I love to share, but am more than open to exploring the region if you or a loved one has a special vision in mind.</p>
